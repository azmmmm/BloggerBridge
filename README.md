# Important Notes!
Do note that: If you simply copy and paste the code, you are **using my server as proxy**. 
I do not guarantee such service to be stable, due to:
1. The code is constantly updated recently.
2. I would ban access for any tendencies of malicious or illegal usage.

# Limitation
Only support a limited range of resouces. That makes your Blogger **LOOK** normal, but not indeed functions like one.



    
    

# My Blogger
Welcome to my Blogger [izumi.pro](https://blog.izumi.pro). You can even access it in **certain areas**!
